Welcome to ScraTap! (Scratch Tap) First, run the scratchtap_compile.py file, and enter the path of the JSON file to be parsed (remember, the full name of this JSON file must be main.st.json) Wait for the generation of xxx.s3exe to complete (if there is an error, check whether there is a syntax error in main.st.json (ST (ScraTap) syntax will be explained later), or whether the corresponding path in "assets" does not have that image file or the file is not an image type) Open the scratchtap_execute.py file and enter the path of the xxx (your file name).s3exe file ST Syntax Explanation (AI Generated): ScratchTap (ScraTap) Programming Language Syntax Details ScratchTap is a programming language that combines Scratch's visual logic with JSON structured configuration. By defining characters, events, instructions, and resources, it can eventually be compiled into a .s3exe executable file. Its syntax core revolves around the JSON configuration file, combining structure and readability. Here is the complete syntax explanation: 1. File Structure The core of a ScraTap project is the main.st.json file, which is divided into three main modules: json {"init": {}, // Project initialization configuration "custom-functions": {}, // Custom functions (optional) "script": {} // Character script logic } 2. Initialization Configuration (init) Defines project metadata, resource mapping and global settings. Required fields: Field Type Description file-name String Project name super-speed-mode Boolean Whether to enable high-speed mode (affects frame rate) export-type String Export format, fixed as .s3exe assets Object Character resource mapping, key is character name, value is the path to the resource file (supports PNG/JPG/SVG etc.) Example: json "init": {"file-name": "Cat Interactive Game", "super-speed-mode": false, "export-type": ".s3exe", "assets": {"Character1": "assets/cat.png", "Background": "assets/bg.jpg"} } 3. Custom Functions (custom-functions, optional) Defines reusable sets of instructions that can be called by function name, suitable for repeating logic: Syntax: json "custom-functions":
